# Desktop architecture

M3a adds explicit vault-password change with session retirement on STALE/UNCERTAIN.
M2b added explicit field-oriented merge and frozen-resolution decisions to M2a
manual token create/update and explicit publication retry/abandonment, building on
M1a session/window lifecycle, observation/diagnostics and refresh, and M1b
logical-token/TOTP browsing. The single-project Swing application consumes
released Maven modules: desktop -> `org.totipo:totipo-storage-nio:0.1.1` ->
`org.totipo:totipo-core:0.1.1`. Desktop does not build Java core/storage from
source. `org.totipo.storage.nio.NioTotipo` remains the filesystem entry point;
`VaultSession`, `VaultState` and other `org.totipo` application APIs remain the
core boundary. Desktop never consumes storage SPI or implementation internals.
Java conformance belongs to the Java release, not the desktop build. Desktop
packages use `org.totipo.desktop`; qualification uses `org.totipo.qualification`.
See [the released dependency](TOTIPO_JAVA_DEPENDENCY.md).

TotipoDesktop: invokeLater
  -> DesktopApplication (EDT ownership)
       -> one persistent ShellFrame / ShellPanel
       -> one serialized application lifecycle executor
       -> zero or one VaultWindowController (including while closing)

                 -> sticky non-secret abandoned-publication boolean
```

`DesktopApplication` owns the current selected path independently of authentication,
one persistent shell, and at most one controller until session close finishes.
The shell renders and emits actions; it does not own protocol behavior.
`ShellView` and `VaultView` are small presentation interfaces for testing these
owners without constructing top-level windows. They are not a general UI framework.

## Threading and entry points

All ownership transitions, user actions and Swing changes occur on the EDT. The
small `Edt` guard checks those boundaries. `TotipoDesktop` only schedules creation
of `DesktopApplication` and shows its persistent shell.

One ordinary JDK single-thread executor, named `totipo-application`, runs blocking
open/create and closes returned sessions that cannot be transferred to a controller.
The package-private `VaultAccess` seam has only `open(Path, char[])` and
`create(Path, char[])`; `NioVaultAccess` delegates directly to `NioTotipo`. Tests
substitute lifecycle outcomes without KDF or filesystem work. No protocol or
storage-provider behavior is reproduced in this seam.

The high-level `NioTotipo.create` result exposes no pre-creation orphan context.
Java exposes that context only through the experimental `NioTotipoStore`/storage
SPI. Adding provider observation, ownership and asynchronous confirmation to this
seam would extend the current architecture; it is deferred for human review.
Desktop currently does not observe `objects-v1` names before creation and therefore
does not provide the recommended observation-triggered orphan warning. Names are
unauthenticated and must never become an automatic creation veto. README creation
guidance is not a claim that this safeguard is implemented.

Each controller owns a separate single-thread executor named `totipo-session-N`.
It runs token builder factory/setters/save/close, publication retry/capability
cleanup, password change, and session close. Blocking open, create, password change
and close never run on the EDT.
Executors are explicitly shut down; no shutdown interrupts an in-flight operation.
The application uses neither SwingWorker nor virtual threads nor reactive libraries.
Production code remains compatible with Java 17.

## Shell, selection, and passwords

Select/Change Vault use an owned modal `DirectoryPicker` with read-only directory
navigation. Create retains its separate Swing directory chooser. The picker has
an informational current path, Up, a directory-only JList occupying the expanding
center, Cancel, and Select This Folder. Enter/double-click navigates; Select
chooses the displayed directory rather than the highlighted child. No file
management, filename/filter or preview controls are constructed. A dedicated
daemon worker performs directory listing off the EDT, closing each stream and
rejecting stale navigation results by generation. Disposal invalidates publication
and shuts down that worker. Application validation/remembering remains outside
the picker, and Select stays activatable for non-vault folders.
Desktop code does not create directories, recursively inspect them, or canonicalize
paths. A bounded read of the public `TOTIPO-VLT` bootstrap signature recognizes
a target without authenticating it or accepting its version/length as valid. A
recognizable selected path is normalized and remembered immediately. Missing or
clearly non-vault targets do not replace it. The NIO open result remains authoritative.
Only one application operation is accepted at a time; actions stay disabled across
chooser/create prompts, work, result presentation and
unclaimed-session cleanup. Modal dialogs can run nested EDT loops, so shutdown is
checked after prompting as well as when the background result reaches the EDT.

Passwords come from `JPasswordField.getPassword()` as desktop-owned `char[]` values.
No password is converted to String, logged, or included in presentation/diagnostics.
Create compares password and confirmation arrays directly. Confirmation is wiped
immediately after comparison; a mismatch also wipes the primary array. Fields are
cleared when dismissed. Cancellation/rejection wipes any retrieved primary array.

`PasswordInput` validates UTF-16 and counts UTF-8 bytes without an encoded copy.
It rejects unpaired surrogates and more than 1024 UTF-8 bytes. Empty input and all
other valid Unicode within the limit are accepted. Creating with an empty password
requires a separate explicit warning/confirmation, with Cancel as the default.
The application reserves the shell during this dialog and rechecks shutdown.
Opening an existing empty-password vault requires no creation confirmation.
Once accepted for background work, the operation owns the primary array and wipes
it in `finally`, whether NIO returns a session, another outcome, or throws. This is
best-effort JVM secret hygiene, not a secure-erasure guarantee. No passwords are
remembered for retries or subsequent Open actions. Unexpected exceptions use generic
application/session failures; exception text and stack traces are not displayed or
logged because they could contain caller-controlled data.

## Lifecycle outcomes

Every public open/create result has distinct handling:

| Result | Desktop behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Opened / Created | Transfer the session once to a registered controller, then start its window/subscription. If construction fails before transfer or shutdown has begun, close the session on the application executor. After transfer, the controller owns all cleanup, including start/subscription failure. |
| Absent | No canonical Totipo vault was observed; never implicitly create. |
| Unavailable | Directory/vault could not be reliably accessed; no password/corruption diagnosis. |
| InvalidVault | Observed vault data could not be used as a valid vault; no repair/replacement. |
| AuthenticationFailed | Authentication did not succeed; this does not prove the password is incorrect, and authenticated data may have changed or become unusable. |
| AlreadyExists | A vault was observed and nothing was overwritten; Open remains an explicit later action. |
| Failed | Definite failure of this create operation; no automatic retry. |
| Uncertain | Creation may have succeeded; canonical outcome cannot be asserted. Do not blindly retry; explicitly use Open Vault to re-observe. |

Unexpected runtime exceptions are application failures, never converted into a
protocol outcome. `Error` is not caught or swallowed. There is no automatic open,
create, observation or lifecycle retry.

## State and replay-latest delivery

`VaultState` is authoritative immutable application state. A controller retains
its latest received reference, clears it on close, and does not maintain a
shadow vault model or state history. An editor separately captures its exact
historical operation base. Swing rendering models are rebuilt from the
current state, not merged into a desktop protocol representation.

The desktop application must not maintain a mutable shadow copy of vault/token state.

`StateSubscriber` requests exactly one item on subscription. `onNext` enqueues an
EDT runnable, which stores/renders the state only while the controller remains
active. Only after rendering does it request one further item. Demand therefore
stays zero while the EDT is pending, allowing the core's replay-latest coalescing
to discard intermediate observations. There is no desktop state queue or unbounded
demand. Cancellation drops the subscription reference and suppresses pending UI
application. Terminal callbacks are also handed to the EDT and handled once.

A stream error marks the session unusable, disables interaction, presents a generic
session failure distinct from observation diagnostics, and begins close. Unexpected
completion retires the session/window cleanly. Explicit close cancels first, so
completion cannot start another close lifecycle. Rendering/runtime failures use
the same terminal cleanup path.

## Local observation presentation

`VaultPanel` delegates token browsing to `TokenBrowserPanel` and reads observation
and diagnostics for the following presentation:

- Enumerating: “Observing local vault — discovered N objects”, with an indeterminate
  bar. The count is not described as final.
- Processing: “Processing local observation — X of Y”, with exact long counts.
  Only the visual bar is scaled to 0–1000 to avoid Swing integer-range overflow.
- Finished: “Local observation finished — N objects processed”, optionally followed
  by “diagnostics present”. This means only that the local pass ended.

The current diagnostic codes replace the previous text, preserving order and
repeated entries. Codes receive no invented causal explanations and are not a
persistent event log. Neither progress nor diagnostics establish freshness,
complete history, remote synchronization, rollback resistance or absence of conflicts.

Refresh invokes `VaultSession.requestRefresh()` directly on the EDT because the
API guarantees a non-blocking request. It is disabled during close. There is no
polling, filesystem watcher, automatic refresh loop or remote sync behavior.

## Lock, close, and shutdown

The sole frame uses `DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE`; window close and File → Exit terminate
the application. Lock/Change Vault idempotently mark the controller closing, cancel the subscriber, drop
the latest reference, disables Refresh and displays “Closing…”. Its session executor
calls `session.close()`. After that call finishes, the executor is shut down and an
EDT callback disposes the retired content and removes the controller from the application.
A runtime close failure is reported generically and still retires the executor and
window, without retry or a claim that unexpected core cleanup failure was repaired.
No frame disposal substitutes for session close.

Exit marks the application shutting down and asks the current controller to close.
No new session content can be accepted thereafter.
An already-running open/create is allowed to finish without interruption. A session
returned after shutdown is explicitly closed on the application executor; passwords
are still wiped normally. The persistent frame remains owned until no application operation
(including prompts, result presentation or unclaimed cleanup) is pending and all
controller has reported closed. Then the application executor shuts down and the
shell is disposed. The EDT never waits for background work. There is no
`System.exit()` shortcut.

Shell states are `NO_VAULT`, `LOCKED`, `UNLOCKED`, and `BLOCKING_VAULT_STATE`.
LOCKED uses a horizontally centered task block capped at 560 logical pixels,
with 24-pixel outer margins and a modest upward bias in the available height.
Its basename heading and path are informational labels; the path has no caret,
focus or input border, and retains its full accessible description and tooltip
when Swing visually ellipsizes it. Password remains a JPasswordField.
NO_VAULT uses the shared `EmptyState`: centered “No vault selected” heading and
compact centered Select Vault / Create New Vault stack, capped at 280 pixels.
`SwingUsability.taskActions` supplies the reusable normal task/dialog
action-row convention: trailing alignment, secondary actions first, primary last,
and eight logical pixels between actions. Toolbars and TokenRow actions retain
their independent layouts.
The unlocked collection has one Search/count/Add row. Search expands; count is
secondary and Add has its natural command width at the trailing edge. Refresh
is menu/F5 only. With zero semantic TOTPs, the header is hidden and the result
area uses EmptyState with No TOTPs yet, explanatory text and primary Add. With
zero search matches, the header remains and EmptyState offers quiet Clear Search.
Filtered count is M of N; unfiltered count is N TOTPs. Clear Search follows the
ordinary filter path and then requests Search focus; it does not derive or extend
reveal authorization. Empty content uses a separate card filling the result area,
so centering follows viewport space rather than list preferred height. The copy
notification still overlays that same result area. Conflict header padding is
balanced above/below its vertically centered title and Resolve control; its
semantic edge, children and resolver callbacks are preserved.
Read-only remains an attribute of usable session state. Wrong password remains
LOCKED with inline feedback; required invalid/unsupported or unavailable state
blocks ordinary token content. Try Again returns to the password form. No raw
password is retained for retry. The existing API cannot distinguish every
authentication failure from damaged authenticated data; feedback makes no proof
of password correctness or corruption.

Lock invalidates application generation, retires controller-owned drafts/reveals/
clipboard and all owned dialogs, stops the inactivity timer, and replaces content
immediately. Session close follows queued session work. Open remains unavailable
until close completes, including unclaimed late-result cleanup. Change Vault waits
for that completion before its chooser; Cancel stays LOCKED, with no session
resurrection. Late open results close unclaimed sessions; existing controller
closing checks reject late observation, derivation, write, and password results.

`InactivityLock` uses an injected wall clock and a fixed 15-minute deadline.
`DesktopEvents` routes direct key presses, pointer activation/drag, and scroll from
the shell or owned windows, with a keyboard dispatcher that intercepts Ctrl+L even
inside modal/modeless flows. Background ticks, observation, publication, rendering,
focus loss and minimization do not reset it. Deadline expiry is checked before
user interaction and on activation/deiconification. Application exit unregisters
event hooks and stops its Swing timer; content retirement stops row timers.

Pure-JDK Desktop user-session/sleep hooks are installed only when supported.
They lock on deactivation/activation and sleep/wake. `ResumeGuard` conservatively
locks on >=30 seconds between event-processing checks or >5 seconds of wall versus
monotonic clock discrepancy. It resets on unlock. This detects many missed resumes
but also locks after long EDT stalls/clock corrections. Unsupported platforms
cannot reliably report OS lock or every short suspend. Event delivery is asynchronous
and cannot guarantee compositor previews before resume notification. No JNI,
native integration, or new dependency was introduced; real desktop qualification
remains required.

## Preserved principles and later work

1. Protocol/application state belongs to `VaultSession` and `VaultState`.
2. Presentation state includes selection, window state and dialogs.
3. Operation state includes editor drafts, captured bases, and outstanding result capabilities.

The desktop must not collapse conflicts into arbitrary winners, partial observation
into completeness, uncertainty into success/failure, local publication into remote
synchronization, or equal causal heads into semantic conflict. No automatic merge,
retry or invented synchronization semantics are introduced.

Sorting, QR/URI import, secret export, keychain, remembered passwords, recent
history, tray, theming, watchers, remote providers, installers and release publishing
remain outside the implemented scope. M3b search/shortcuts and M3c explicit TOTP
clipboard copying are described below.

## Verification

Headless tests construct panels and drive lifecycle owners on the EDT, using narrow
fake views/access/sessions and controlled publishers/latches. They test lifecycle
outcomes, password validation/wiping, subscriber backpressure, terminal/cancel
races, observation-only rendering, refresh, independent session close and shutdown
during open/create. M1a fake states reject unexpected token/editing/TOTP methods;
M2a adds public-interface write fakes; M2b adds merge/partial fakes and deterministic
close barriers. Real-NIO temporary-directory tests cover
create/close/open/close, TOTP intervals, desktop token create/update, and a real
conflict created by historical concurrent updates then explicitly merged. Build/test also
verify every production class is Java 17 classfile version 61. No new production or
test dependencies were needed.

## Logical-token browser and TOTP (M1b)

One row represents one logical token. Complete semantic alternatives, including
secret-only differences, determine conflict; equal-valued multiple heads do not.
Selection follows TokenId across immutable projections. Alternative labels express
no preference. Incomplete observations retain their unresolved evidence and never
invent an editable value. Stored issuer/account/metadata render literally with
display-only escapes for backslashes, control characters and direction/format
characters. List and merge-choice renderers disable HTML. Editing retains exact
model strings, including embedded newlines; text-field newline filtering is
disabled so an ordinary update cannot silently replace them with spaces.

TOTP uses the public state/alternative operation and core-returned half-open time
intervals. A coalescing Swing timer updates the display; opening an editor does
not stop it. Latest states continue rendering during editing and uncertainty.
No success result directly changes a row, selection, descriptor or code.

## Desktop drafts and secret ingress (M2a)

`TokenManagementPanel` is the session-owned S3 task surface, mounted in a modeless
child of the persistent shell. Its stages separate URI/manual acquisition, parsed
review, explicit duplicate decision, setup replacement review, identity Edit, and
Delete confirmation. It never owns a Java builder. `SetupDraft` owns new secret
bytes and a secret-free `TokenDescriptor` review; transfer produces the common
`TokenDraft`. Identity Edit uses the captured descriptor setup and no secret
ingress. Change Setup uses every acquired setup field together and the target's
saved identity. Delete uses the target's descriptor with TOMBSTONED status and no
secret ingress. No desktop protocol persistence is implemented.

`SetupUri` is a small TOTP-only application ingress parser because the consumed
published Java 0.1.1 JAR has no enrollment parser. It rejects HOTP, malformed URIs,
ambiguous/repeated or unsupported parameters, issuer disagreement, invalid Base32,
unsupported algorithms/digits, and out-of-domain periods. URI secrets use strict
Base32. `SetupValidation` applies Java's identity UTF-8 limits and setup bounds;
empty identities remain supported. The existing `Base32` decoder permits
space/tab/CR/LF/hyphen in manual entry. URI/JVM string copies cannot be wiped, but
input char arrays, acquired bytes, submitted bytes and secret-bearing Swing fields
have explicit retirement paths; no ingress value is included in diagnostics.

`IdentityMatches` reads only current active descriptors and exact issuer/account
values. It does not read secret comparison groups, causal heads, timestamps, or
codes. Multiple candidates have no preselected target. If the emitted state changes
before a duplicate decision is committed, the choice must be reviewed again.
Update Existing converges on the same setup replacement mutation as Change Setup.

Submit actions remain available with incomplete input. Activation rejects invalid
input before submission, exposes a local field message and accessible description,
and requests focus/scroll to the first problem. Acquisition leads to a separate
review action. Secondary task cancellation returns to Edit; shell retirement
always discards the entire flow. A queued validated draft is atomically transferred
to the session executor, or promptly wiped on retirement before execution.

Saved publication carries its token ID and acknowledged revisions back to the
view. The view waits for those revisions in emitted state before bringing the
result into view or showing the modest hidden-by-search notice. It does not insert
an optimistic row or reveal a code. Pure deleted logical TOTPs are omitted from
the active collection; existing conflict child presentation remains unchanged.
The legacy `TokenEditorPanel`/`TokenEditDialog` is retained for the older isolated
editor boundary tests and shared sizing/scroll-body helpers, but S3 actions route
exclusively through `TokenManagementPanel`. Conflict resolution itself is deferred
to S4 and retains its existing MergeEditorPanel/publication behavior.

A submitted `TokenDraft` exclusively owns its decoded byte array and immutable
non-secret descriptor. Ownership transfers to one executor task. `TokenWrites`
creates `base.createToken()` or `base.update(capturedAlternative)` there, applies
all fields, saves, and closes the builder on that same thread. A try-with-resources
draft scope wipes bytes even when factory/setter/save fails. After
`NewSecret.copyOf` defensively copies ingress, the desktop array is immediately
wiped; `builder.secret` synchronously copies the wrapper, which closes immediately.
No wrapper or plaintext draft is retained for retries. Without replacement, no
secret ingress call is made. All wiping is best-effort JVM hygiene, not secure
erasure. A definite failure retains editable non-secret form fields, but requires
fresh secret input when the operation needs it.

## Captured update basis and serialized workflow

The browser offers Edit Token for one complete semantic alternative, including
multiple equal heads. A conflicted token offers an initially unselected
Alternative N selector and Edit Alternative…; explanatory text appears before
opening the editor in that choice dialog. The normal editor has only a concise
deletion-history helper. No complete alternative means no edit.

Opening captures the exact receiving VaultState and TokenAlternative. New state
emissions neither rewrite the draft nor replace this basis. Historical same-session
references are valid. Ordinary update uses only the deterministic equal-valued
heads selected by that receiving state (or the alternative's captured heads).
It does not parent unrelated alternatives, invoke a merge gate or resolve conflict.
No head-level update, rebasing, winner selection or merge exists in this path.

`TokenWriteController` admits one write workflow per window, including merge and
partial-resolution decisions. Create/Edit/Resolve disable throughout it; Refresh and ordinary state/TOTP delivery stay
available. Save validation occurs on EDT, then controls disable before one task
is submitted to the existing session executor. Repeated clicks cannot queue more
writes. There is no extra executor, subscription, polling or automatic retry.

## Publication results and capability ownership

| Result | Desktop behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Saved | Retire editor/uncertainty; acknowledge token publication; restore write actions. This is configured-store durability acknowledgement, not sync, conflict resolution or global freshness. |
| Failed(PREPARATION_FAILED) | Explain definite non-publication; leave non-secret fields editable for an explicit new builder operation from the same base. |
| Failed(OBSERVATION_UNAVAILABLE) | State that required local observation was unavailable and the operation was not published; retain editable form. |
| Failed(UNRESOLVED_FIELDS) | State definite non-publication without inventing missing values; retain editable form. |
| Failed(SESSION_CLOSING) | Begin orderly window/session close; no retry choice. |
| PublicationUncertain | Retire editor; keep exact retry capability on executor; show Retry exact publication / Stop retrying. May already be present in the vault. |
| AdditionalConflict from create/update | Defensive invariant failure only: close the returned PartialResolution on executor, show generic internal failure, never publish it or expose merge choices. |

The pinned publication attempt requests local refresh after Saved.
The desktop does not request an additional refresh and never uses observation as
acknowledgement. Runtime exceptions produce a generic internal-operation message,
not a fabricated SaveResult; exception details, drafts and codes are not logged.

Only the session executor accesses the retry field. EDT receives classification
and callbacks, never a capability. An explicit retry takes and clears the old
handle, invokes `retryPublication()` on the session executor using narrow
`RetryResult`, installs the successor on uncertainty, and closes the consumed
old handle. There is never a second builder or semantic reconstruction. Saved
drops uncertainty with no abandonment notice; successive uncertain results own
successive independent handles. Both actions disable during an attempt.

Stop closes the handle on the executor and sets a sticky session presentation
boolean. It does not undo publication or prove failure. Later observation,
Refresh, or unrelated Saved operations cannot clear it. The only retained history
is this non-secret boolean. Create explains that starting again makes a distinct
token and may lead to two logical tokens if an earlier uncertain create persisted.
An unexpected retry exception retires the unusable handle and also preserves the
uncertainty history with a generic internal failure message.

## Close versus editor/save/retry

Close marks the controller closing on EDT, cancels its one state subscription,
retires the editor and clears its field, disables all write entry points, and
clears uncertainty presentation. It queues capability cleanup followed by session
close on the same executor. It never interrupts a save/retry or waits on EDT.
An in-flight task may install a returned successor on the executor; queued cleanup
then releases it before session close. Late EDT callbacks check closing and never
reopen an editor, reinstall uncertainty UI, or start another retry. Session close
still invalidates core-owned handles, even if an unexpected cleanup failure occurs.


## Explicit merge resolution (M2b)

Resolve Conflict… is separate from Edit Alternative… and appears only for
`hasConflict()` with at least two complete semantic alternatives. Equal heads,
diagnostics, or unresolved references alone do not enable it. Unresolved references
do not veto a real semantic conflict; the existing technical warning remains visible.
Tombstoned alternatives are complete merge inputs, without any status preference.

`MergeInputs` captures the exact receiving `VaultState`, `TokenState`, token ID
through that token, complete alternative list and descriptive `TokenCompetition`
when the workflow opens. Later state emissions continue to drive the browser/TOTP
but never rewrite the capture. Input selection initially includes every captured
alternative, with literal descriptors and head IDs. Alternative numbers express no
priority. At least two must be selected; changing a single alternative belongs to
ordinary Edit Alternative.

Continue freezes a copied list of selected alternatives. All-selected Save calls
exactly `capturedBase.merge(tokenId)` for the receiving state's full frontier.
A deliberately selected strict subset calls exactly
`capturedBase.merge(selectedAlternatives)` with those captured references. Omitted
alternatives are not silently included, and the form warns they may remain competing.
The desktop never treats an omitted member of the original frontier as new information.

`MergeInputs.selectedCompetition()` intersects each core field-value membership and
secret-group membership with the selection, discarding empty intersections. It
retains the core's values and equality groups; descriptors, heads, metadata time and
TOTP codes do not establish equality or voting priority. Going Back discards field
choices and clears new-secret input; the input step preserves the checked subset
for deliberate changes and builds a fresh resolution form on Continue.

The modeless `MergeEditorPanel` resolves status, issuer, account, algorithm, digits,
period and secret independently. Agreed fields are prefilled and remain changeable;
disagreeing fields start without a selection and disable Save until explicitly
resolved. Existing choices include their Alternative memberships. Status and
algorithm permit all pinned enum values. Issuer/account offer literal Other… text,
with no added string policy. Digits and integral-second period use the same public
`TokenDescriptor` validation as M2a (6–8 and 1–4294967295). Controls and renderers
render stored strings literally, without Swing HTML.

Secret groups expose only Alternative memberships. One agreed group defaults to
keeping it; multiple groups have no default. Replacement accepts the M2a Base32
caller-secret ingress. The submitted `MergeDraft` owns immutable non-secret fields,
`MergeInputs`, a captured representative alternative for an existing secret group,
or newly decoded owned bytes. It contains no builder, secret choice, partial or
retry capability. It delegates field application/secret ingress to the small M2a
`TokenDraft` helper without changing ordinary create/update semantics.

`MergeWrites` constructs, inspects (`competingValues`, `secretChoices`,
`unresolvedFields`), populates, saves and closes a short-lived `MergeToken` entirely
on the session executor. A descriptive `SecretGroup` is never passed to it. The
representative alternative must match exactly one choice issued by this exact
builder; missing/ambiguous mappings publish nothing. All intended fields are applied,
and an unexpectedly nonempty unresolved list prevents save. `NewSecret.copyOf`
occurs there, immediately wipes desktop bytes, synchronously supplies the builder,
and closes promptly. Draft scope also wipes on factory/setter/save failure.
Metadata remains at the public API default.

The core alone owns the normal merge fresh-observation/new-information gate,
including causal relevance of new heads with already-known semantic values. There
is no second desktop freshness check or latest-state substitution.

## Merge results, partial ownership and renewed review

Normal merge Saved says “Merge publication acknowledged.” The editor retires; only
emitted states change browser rows. This promises neither global conflict freedom
nor peer observation. All definite Failed reasons retain editable non-secret form
state for a deliberate new Save from the same base, except SESSION_CLOSING, which
starts close. OBSERVATION_UNAVAILABLE explicitly states that nothing was published;
it is not a conflict result. Consumed replacement secrets must be re-entered.

AdditionalConflict is definite non-publication, with newly relevant information
and an independently owned frozen original resolution. The builder is terminal.
The controller retires the form, keeps `PartialResolution` only in executor-owned
operation state, and presents Review latest and merge again (the normal/default
action), Publish original resolution anyway, and Cancel. Neither publication nor
review happens automatically. Subsequent state emissions cannot alter that partial.

Review Latest or Cancel takes and clears the owned partial, then closes it on the
session executor without save. Cleanup errors produce a generic cleanup message,
not persistence uncertainty; session close is the final invalidation backstop.
After cleanup, Review looks up the full TokenId in `AdditionalConflict.latest()`.
A remaining conflict opens a fresh input-selection workflow using exactly that state,
with all its alternatives selected and no prior resolutions, subset or new secret.
Otherwise the workflow ends with an explanation. The supplied state never replaces
the browser's latest emitted state. Repeated AdditionalConflict/Review cycles are
unbounded human decisions, each retiring the previous partial.

Publish Original requires a second explicit confirmation explaining that it uses
the exact original selected inputs and resolution, omits newly observed information,
and skips the merge new-information check. It can leave competing alternatives.
Only the executor calls `PartialResolution.save()`; it constructs no new merge or
update and performs no desktop semantic gate. The narrowed `PartialSaveResult`
permits only Saved, Failed, and PublicationUncertain:

- Saved consumes/retires the partial and says “Original merge resolution publication
  acknowledged.” It does not claim the new conflict was resolved.
- Failed retires/closes the partial, states definite non-publication, and restores
  write actions (or closes for SESSION_CLOSING). It never saves the same partial again.
- PublicationUncertain retires the partial and transfers sole publication authority
  to the independently returned `PublicationRetry`.

Normal and partial merge uncertainty reuse M2a's exact-byte retry/stop machinery,
with operation-specific wording. There is no Review Latest action while a retry
is owned, no plaintext recipe retained for retry, and no merge reconstruction.
Stop remains sticky across observations and later acknowledged writes.

## Merge close races and cleanup knowledge

The one-write-workflow slot covers input selection, field editing, normal merge,
AdditionalConflict decisions, partial save and publication retry. Refresh, state
rendering and TOTP remain independent until close. Closing clears unsaved secret
input and disables the modeless editor without creating a builder. An in-flight
merge, partial save or retry is never interrupted. Executor cleanup is queued
behind that work and ahead of session close, including capabilities returned while
closing. No late completion may reopen decision or retry UI; unpublished partials
are closed without save, without creating sticky uncertainty solely from abandonment.

Once a save returns a semantic result, subsequent builder/handle cleanup cannot
erase it. AdditionalConflict keeps its independent partial despite builder-close
failure; partial Saved/Failed/PublicationUncertain survive partial-close failure,
including ownership of a usable retry successor. Cleanup logs are generic and
redacted. Tests use public fakes and deterministic latches for these races; the
real NIO smoke does not attempt to manufacture AdditionalConflict with filesystem races.

## Explicit password-wrapper change (M3a)

The unlocked vault content offers **Change Vault Password…**. Rewrap
retains the root and does not rewrite TOKEN objects. There is no fingerprint UI,
fingerprint authorization, token rewrite, secret rotation, password caching, or
password recovery subsystem. Only public `VaultSession.changePassword` is invoked.

`MutationGate` is a small EDT-owned per-window reservation. `TokenWriteController`
keeps its existing token semantics and owns the reservation throughout Create,
Update, Merge, AdditionalConflict, partial save, and publication retry/stop cleanup.
`PasswordChangeController` acquires the same reservation before opening its modeless
form, retaining it throughout submitted work and editable definite failures. The
gate disables Create/Edit/Resolve/Change Password and rejects stale callbacks as
well as clicks. A sticky abandoned token-publication notice owns no capability and
therefore reserves no slot. Password handling never clears that notice.

`PasswordChangePanel` is independently constructible headlessly. The owned
`PasswordChangeDialog` only supplies the Swing window and forwards close to Cancel
when cancellation is allowed. The form uses three `JPasswordField`s, calls only
`getPassword`, and never converts passwords to Strings. `PasswordChangeSubmission`
reuses `PasswordInput` for current and new arrays: valid UTF-16 and at most 1024
UTF-8 bytes. Empty and identical passwords are allowed. It compares new and
confirmation arrays directly and wipes confirmation immediately after comparison
(or on validation rejection). Rejection wipes current/new too. The panel clears
all three documents before disabling controls and invoking the submission callback.
Cancel or vault close clears unsent documents and constructs no operation.

One submission owns the two remaining caller arrays exclusively. It travels only
to one task on the existing `totipo-session-N` executor, never into application,
window, state presentation, preferences or recovery state. The blocking call is
inside `try/finally`; both arrays are overwritten and references dropped on every
return or exception. Rejected scheduling also wipes the submission. This is
best-effort caller-buffer hygiene, not secure JVM erasure. There is no new executor,
SwingWorker, polling, or second subscription. State rendering, selection, Refresh
and TOTP continue independently while the form or operation is active.

| Password result | Desktop handling |
| --- | --- |
| CHANGED | Record positive wrapper acknowledgement, retire form, release reservation, acknowledge concisely. Same session stays open. No browser mutation, token refresh, or reopen. |
| AUTHENTICATION_FAILED | Explain authentication of observed vault data did not succeed and does not prove mistyping; this attempt did not change the password. Keep session and form, enable fresh explicit entry. |
| FAILED | Explain definite required observation/staging failure and non-change by this attempt. Keep session and form, enable fresh explicit entry. No uncertainty inferred. |
| STALE | Explain authenticated root/canonical BASE changed before replacement, which this attempt did not perform. Immediately retire the current session as an unacceptable basis for continued work; require explicit reopen. No either-password claim. |
| UNCERTAIN | Explain replacement lacked durable acknowledgement and either password may be canonical. Immediately retire session and require explicit reopen/re-observation. No retry handle, automatic retry, rollback, or password preference. |

Password UNCERTAIN is distinct from TOKEN `PublicationUncertain`, `PartialResolution`,
and `PublicationRetry`. It has no frozen token publication bytes or exact-publication
retry. The shared gate prevents overlap with live token capabilities; token sticky
history neither blocks rewrap nor becomes evidence about its outcome.

An unexpected RuntimeException produces no fabricated PasswordChangeResult. The
controller records the absence of a typed result separately, wipes input, and
conservatively retires with a generic redacted message explaining that no outcome
can be inferred. It catches neither Throwable nor Error. SessionClosedException
uses the ordinary close lifecycle without a fresh password-error workflow. Typed
result knowledge is recorded before presentation cleanup; a later UI exception
cannot reclassify it. Cleanup errors are handled separately and redacted.

STALE/UNCERTAIN retirement immediately marks the window closing on EDT, disables
actions, clears the form, cancels state presentation and stops TOTP through the
existing close path. Session close is queued on the session executor. After close
and content retirement, `DesktopApplication` presents the reopen-required explanation
in BLOCKING_VAULT_STATE, unless shutdown has begun. No interactive stale session
remains while it is read. There is no automatic Open. Try Again and an explicit Open create an ordinary new
session with no old state, heads, alternatives, partial/retry handles or password
arrays carried into it.

Window close and application shutdown mark closing immediately, clear unsent
forms, and queue cleanup/close behind any submitted password call. They never
interrupt KDF/replacement or wait on EDT. Every eventual typed result retains its
meaning internally, including CHANGED, but late delivery cannot restore controls,
reopen the form or show normal success/error UI. STALE/UNCERTAIN close remains
idempotent. Application shutdown waits for existing controller completion and
suppresses post-close password messages. Presentation cleanup failure cannot
prevent queued session close or stop shutdown of other windows.


## Presentation usability (M3b)

The browser retains the latest authoritative VaultState, a temporary search-field
query and ordinary presentation rows. Search never alters/copies protocol state or
creates a second domain database. Matching uses Locale.ROOT case-insensitive
whitespace-separated AND substrings
across the displayed issuer/account of one complete Alternative. No internal
identifiers or credential/configuration fields are searched. Empty query matches
all logical tokens, including incomplete observations. Displayed primary/secondary
identity determines case-insensitive stable ordering, both for Alternatives and
outer entries (a conflict sorts by its first ordered Alternative). One child is
rendered per semantic Alternative, with conflict/unresolved detail intact and no
winning alternative.

New states retain the query and resolve surviving selection by full TokenId.
A removed or filtered-out selection is cleared; clearing the filter never restores
it or selects a replacement. Counts distinguish all logical tokens from matches;
empty vault and no-match text are separate from observation status/diagnostics.
Search is not persisted, logged or included in titles/diagnostics.

Find, Refresh and Create use Swing action maps. Button and shortcut Refresh/Create
share Actions and enabled state; MutationGate retains sole workflow ownership.
Dialog Escape forwards existing guarded Cancel cleanup, and busy work cannot be
interrupted. Ordinary form defaults are Save/Continue/Change; AdditionalConflict
keeps Review Latest as default and uncertainty has no default. Original publication
remains an explicit confirmed decision. There are no destructive shortcuts.

Focus requests occur only after showing the vault or through user actions, never
from state emissions. Standard list navigation remains intact. Accessible metadata
must never contain entered passwords or secrets. Current visible TOTP label text
remains accessible and is cleared with the existing code lifetime; static descriptions
contain no codes. Labels identify inputs, conflict/unresolved evidence remains text,
and bounded windows with scrollable content avoid user-controlled pack dimensions.

## Explicit TOTP clipboard copying (M3c)

Clipboard is application-global presentation state, outside VaultState, observation,
publication and synchronization. DesktopApplication owns one TotpClipboard shared by
all vault controllers. Each controller has an opaque Object origin identity and gives
its view only a guarded Copy callback. No state subscription, MutationGate reservation,
protocol capability, session executor or storage operation participates.

Each displayed available ACTIVE semantic alternative has its own Copy code button.
Equal digits never merge alternatives. TotpDisplay validates its cached core TotpCode
against its injected Clock on activation: validFrom <= now < validUntil. If outside,
it invokes the existing tick path, then checks the clock and returned interval again.
Clipboard code performs no TOTP generation or period arithmetic. Retired/detached
buttons and closing controller callbacks cannot copy. Ordinary text-copy shortcuts
remain Swing's; no global copy binding or focus request is installed.

TotpClipboardPayload exposes exactly stringFlavor with the unmodified code String
and application/x-totipo-copy-marker with a UUID v4 String generated per copy.
The marker contains no token, code, issuer/account or path data. The payload is its
ClipboardOwner. The manager retains at most one lease: marker, origin, scheduled
cancellation and bounded-clear bookkeeping. It retains no code/payload, vault object
or copy history. The clipboard necessarily holds an immutable Java String; it cannot
be securely wiped. Replacing/retiring leases releases their desktop references.

A successful setContents replaces the previous Totipo lease directly, with no
intervening empty write. Its deadline is min(core validUntil, copyInstant + 30 seconds).
A one-shot Swing Timer schedules the attempt, subtracting elapsed time before
scheduling and rounding up to milliseconds. These timers run on EDT, independently
of the application NIO executor and session mutation/close executors. Timer delivery
is best effort and can be delayed by a busy desktop/EDT. Selection, search, state
emission and TOTP rollover neither clear nor rewrite a copy.

Clearing first verifies that the callback's lease is still current, then reads the
current Transferable and requires its marker flavor and exact marker equality.
Only then does it write an empty plain-text StringSelection and retire the lease.
Unknown/missing/different markers retire the lease without writing. Text equality
is never an ownership test: an external copy of identical digits must survive.
lostOwnership is only evidence of loss, never proof of continued ownership through
its absence. It posts to EDT and retires only the matching marker; a delayed old
callback cannot affect a newer lease. Every retry repeats the current-payload check.

Copy acquisition/write failures (headless, denied or busy clipboard) return a
non-secret failure status, create no new lease and schedule no copy retry. A failed
replacement leaves any prior successful lease intact. Clear inspection/write
unavailability retries at 250 ms intervals for up to five seconds, with at most
20 retries (also bounding backward-clock behavior). Late retries past the deadline
retire without writing. There is no sleep, busy loop, executor or persistent
diagnostic. No clear-success claim is shown.

Controller close guards copy immediately and conditionally clears only its origin;
closing A cannot clear a newer copy from B. Application shutdown rejects further
copies and attempts current-lease clearing. Already-running retries are not restarted.
Cleanup does not wait for availability, session close or disposal; pending bounded
Swing attempts remain best effort during process teardown. No System.exit is used.
Previous clipboard contents are never snapshotted or restored; the only read is
the identity check for a Totipo lease.

After export, Totipo no longer has exclusive control: OS/desktop clipboard history,
clipboard managers, remote desktop, accessibility software and other applications
can read or retain the code. Totipo cannot delete those copies. JDK Clipboard offers
no atomic cross-application compare-and-set: the marker check and replacement are
separate platform calls. This is a conservative best-effort current-content cleanup,
not secure erasure or a guarantee against concurrent OS clipboard activity.

## Packaging boundary (M4a)

The Gradle application distribution is the canonical launcher plus runtime-JAR
layout. The Linux Nix derivation consumes that layout and fixes JAVA_HOME to the
full pinned desktop-capable JDK; it does not introduce another application entry
point or storage policy. Generic archives rely on user-supplied Java 17 or newer.
VERSION is shared by Gradle and Nix; it identifies a development state until a
candidate is deliberately chosen. Package construction does not declare a release.

Only generated launch scripts default to `-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism`, reducing
JVM Attach API availability in this password/TOTP application. It does not prevent
same-user inspection or memory attacks. Development `run` remains debuggable.
Distribution verification permits only desktop/core/storage-nio/Bouncy Castle
JARs and license material; it checks all Totipo production classfiles for Java 17.
No runtime reduction, update network path, icon, default vault path or installer
framework is introduced. Packaging and vault storage remain separate.

The explicit filesystem harness is separate from both production and default
CI tests. It consumes public high-level NioTotipo APIs beneath an operator-chosen
test root, with a unique disposable child and bounded observation waits. Native
GUI/clipboard and filesystem qualification remain evidence about exact environments,
not protocol guarantees or general platform support.
